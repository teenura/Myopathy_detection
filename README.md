# Myopathy_detection

Healthy.xlsx and Myopathy.xlxs contain EEG voltage taken at 1000 time instances of 50 samples each.

Empiricaal Mode Decomposition has been used to split each signal into 5 Intrinsic Mode Functions(IMF) to increase number of data points and to compensate for the small number of samples. 
findpeaks.m and imf_bearing.m have been utilised for this. 
The following examples are generated by this.

Myopathy Signal

ApEn.m, FuzzyEn.m, and SampEn.m have been provided a by a team of researchers at NUS, that generate Approximate entropy, Fuzzy Entropy, and Sample Entropy for each IMF.
Shannon Entropy is calculated from the three above. The feature datasets generated by main.m are collated to give healthy feature.xlsx and myopathyfeatur.xlsx.

Each colour represents an IMF for each signal and the 4 columns for every colour represent the 4 entropies.

Then ANOVA test was run on 7 random samples from each dataset to test if each entropy for two types of signals came from two separate distributions denoted by low p value(almost close to 0). Shannon entropy failed to give low p values and thus discarded.

Classification.m trained SVM with multipe kernels, k-Nearest-Neighbor, Decision Tree, etc on the feature set. Evaluate.m tested the various models on unseen data. SVM with linear kernel had the best performance on this dataset across all IMFs
